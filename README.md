# dapt
A utility for Elementary OS that integrates dpkg with apt.
## Atention
Attention for now the program is only in Portuguese, soon will be in English.

## How to install
Download program in this [link](https://github.com/FelipeAlafy/dapt/blob/main/dapt), paste the program on downloads folder, don't delete this.
* To use, open your terminal and execute `./dapt` follow the name package, for example __discord.deb__.
* To run the program of any location on elementary os, paste the program on PATH, an example is `export PATH=$PATH:/home/$USER/FOLDER_THAT_THE_PROGRAM_CAN_BE_FOUND`
I'm recommend create a directory, has called Programs on your Home folder, to use like path. If you did that, you only run `dapt` no more `./dapt`. Of course you have to take the packages as an argument.
